# VAME in a Nutshell
VAME is a framework to cluster behavioral signals obtained from pose-estimation tools. It is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) based deep learning framework which leverages the power of recurrent neural networks (RNN) to model sequential data. In order to learn the underlying complex data distribution we use the RNN in a variational autoencoder setting to extract the latent state of the animal in every time step.

The workflow of VAME consists of 5 steps and we explain them in detail [here](https://github.com/LINCellularNeuroscience/VAME/wiki/1.-VAME-Workflow).

## Installation
To get started we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) with Python 3.6 or higher. 
Here, you can create a [virtual enviroment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to store all the dependencies necessary for VAME.

* Install the current stable Pytorch release using the OS-dependent instructions from the [Pytorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Currently, VAME is tested on PyTorch 1.5.
* Go to the locally cloned VAME directory and run `python setup.py install` in order to install VAME in your active Python environment.

## Getting Started
First, you should make sure that you have a GPU powerful enough to train deep learning networks. In our paper, we were using a single Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti to train our network. A hardware guide can be found [here](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/). Once you have your hardware ready, try VAME following the [workflow guide](https://github.com/LINCellularNeuroscience/VAME/wiki/1.-VAME-Workflow).
